# Spikes
Spikes are a concept commonly used in agile project management, particularly in software development. 
A spike is a type of task that is aimed at answering a question or gathering enough information to reduce uncertainty
before more significant development takes place.

# Key Characteristics of Spikes:

1. **Purpose**: Spikes are usually conducted to explore, research, or investigate a specific technical or design problem.

    - Example scenarios:
        - Understanding a new technology or tool.
        - Investigating a performance issue.
        - Exploring how to implement complex features.
        - Evaluating the feasibility of a solution.

2. **Output**: The main "deliverable" of a spike is knowledge, clarity, or guidance.

    - This could take the form of documentation, prototypes, proof of concepts, or recommendations.

3. **Types**:

    - **Technical Spike**: 
    Investigate technical concerns, such as estimating the complexity of integrating with an external service.
    
    - **Functional Spike**:
    Explore functionality of features, like determining whether specific business requirements can be met.

4. **Timeboxing**: Spikes are usually timeboxed, meaning the team allocates a fixed amount of time to focus on them. This ensures they do not consume disproportionate effort.

### Example Workflow for a Spike:

1. Identify the area of uncertainty or risk.
2. Create a spike task in the sprint or backlog.
3. Perform the investigation (could involve writing test code, reviewing technologies, drafting designs, etc.).
4. Document findings and make recommendations.
5. Use the spike results to guide future tasks.

**In Context of the queries**: For instance, in the SQL queries mentioned:

- A spike might be introduced for investigating how to optimize the conversion logic when combining balances in `AUD`, ensuring accuracy while maintaining performance.
- Another spike could focus on integrating new exchange rates efficiently or investigating tools to improve database query performance for asset portfolios.

Spikes are not just limited to coding but are a general concept in managing uncertainty or improving decision-making.
