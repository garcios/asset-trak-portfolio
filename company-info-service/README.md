# Company Information Service

## AI Generated Content
Here's an idea on how I will use Open AI and Redis to generate content for a company.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
	"github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai"
)

// Initialize Redis client
var ctx = context.Background()
var redisClient = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
	Addr: "localhost:6379", // Change if needed
})

// OpenAI API Key (use environment variable in production)
var openaiClient = openai.NewClient(os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

// Hash function for caching
func hashPrompt(prompt string) string {
	hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(prompt))
	return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:])
}

// Function to get response from cache or OpenAI API
func getOpenAIResponse(prompt string) (string, error) {
	// Generate hash key for Redis
	cacheKey := hashPrompt(prompt)

	// Check Redis cache
	cachedResponse, err := redisClient.Get(ctx, cacheKey).Result()
	if err == nil {
		return cachedResponse, nil // Cache hit
	}

	// If cache miss, fetch from OpenAI API
	req := openai.ChatCompletionRequest{
		Model: openai.GPT4Turbo,
		Messages: []openai.ChatCompletionMessage{
			{Role: "system", Content: "You are a financial analyst providing detailed and accurate stock analysis."},
			{Role: "user", Content: prompt},
		},
	}
	resp, err := openaiClient.CreateChatCompletion(ctx, req)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	responseText := resp.Choices[0].Message.Content

	// Store response in Redis with a 24-hour expiration
	err = redisClient.Set(ctx, cacheKey, responseText, 24*time.Hour).Err()
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Failed to cache response:", err)
	}

	return responseText, nil
}

// Main function to start server
func main() {
	prompt := "Summarize the latest news and sentiment analysis for NVIDIA (NVDA) stock. Include key headlines and their" +
		" potential impact on the stock price."

	response, err := getOpenAIResponse(prompt)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Error getting response:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(response)

}

```

## Sample response
Here’s the output I received after executing the code above.

As of my last update, I don't have real-time access to current market news or the ability to browse the internet, including specific headlines or sentiment analyses directly from online sources or databases. However, I can guide you on the general factors that typically influence NVIDIA’s stock and how you might interpret news and sentiment around this company.

**General Factors Influencing NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock:**

1. **Product Launches and Innovations:** NVIDIA, being a leading player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) segment, regularly impacts the market with its product launches. Innovative products focusing on AI, gaming, data centers, and autonomous vehicles usually lead to positive sentiments.

2. **Earnings Reports:** Positive earnings results can lead to stock price increases. Earnings that surpass analysts' expectations are particularly favorable, while any earnings misses can negatively affect the stock.

3. **Market Conditions:** Broader market conditions and tech industry performance also play critical roles. For example, sector-wide downturns or recessions can drag down even high-performing company stocks like NVIDIA.

4. **Regulatory and Legal News:** Changes in technology laws, patent disputes, or other legal issues can also impact stock prices either positively or negatively depending on the nature of the news.

5. **Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions:** Announcements about new partnerships or acquisitions can lead to positive future expectations and increase investor optimism.

6. **Global Supply Chain Impact:** As seen in recent times, disruptions in the global supply chain, especially in semiconductor manufacturing, can affect NVIDIA's production capabilities and subsequently its stock price.

**Conducting Sentiment Analysis:**

To perform a sentiment analysis specific to NVIDIA you might:
- Look at financial news websites, analyst reports, and press releases for the latest NVIDIA-specific news.
- Analyze the tone and frequency of the news—positive, neutral, or negative.
- Consider the reliability of the sources and the relevance of the news.
- Monitor social media and investment forums to gauge retail and institutional investor sentiment.
- Use tools or platforms that provide sentiment scores based on AI analysis of news and social media trends.

**Responding to News:**

Investors often react quickly to news, whether through fundamental analysis or technical response, leading to potential volatility in stock prices. Whether the reaction is justified by the company’s long-term fundamentals or is merely speculative can vary, so it's essential for investors to analyze the context and source of the news alongside the content.

To stay up-to-date on NVIDIA and its impact on stock prices, consider setting up news alerts through financial news aggregators, following reputable financial news outlets, and using professional financial services that provide detailed analysis and sentiment indicators. Remember, staying informed with accurate and timely information is crucial for effective stock analysis and decision-making.
